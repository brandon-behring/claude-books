# claude-books — project roadmap

> Canonical forward plan + current state. **What each companion owns:** [`BOOK-MAP.md`](./BOOK-MAP.md)
> = the book model & scopes · [`REPO-MAP.md`](./REPO-MAP.md) = git topology · [`cert-coverage.md`](./cert-coverage.md)
> = cert-book status (authority) · [`scaffold-gaps.md`](./scaffold-gaps.md) = scaffold epics ·
> [`research-program/`](./research-program/) = the strict-live dossiers. Last updated 2026-06-17.

## The series (model + status)

**Public = 3 books + a shared glossary layer** (single content-bearing trunk `main`):

| Book | Lens | Identity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handbook/` | Use | Claude Code, daily practice (not API / claude.ai) | Part I shipped (4/15 ch prose); ch05–15 port pending |
| `architect-reference/` | Cert | Self-contained CCA-F D1–D5 study guide | 30 ch authored, Round-2 study-guide COMPLETE (2026-06-02) |
| `agentic-systems-design/` | Design | The broad book — **multi-volume** (see below) | **Vols 1–3 all drafted — Design v1.0 COMPLETE 2026-06-14** (Vol 1 11 ch · Vol 2 ch12–20 · Vol 3 ch21–28, 28 ch / 34 pages); applied (v2.0) pending |
| `glossary/` | Vocabulary | Shared deep-link term layer — **infrastructure, not a book** | v1 shipped 2026-06-13 — 70-term bank + sync infra; cert consumer live |

**Agentic Systems Design — the volumes** (foundation-first):
Vol 1 **Environment & Context** *(drafted)* → Vol 2 **Tools & Orchestration** → Vol 3 **Evaluation &
Operations** → **+ a problem-first applied volume** (re-traverses the material through real problems;
reviews + breadcrumbs back to Vols 1–3). **Design v1.0 = Vols 1–3**; the applied volume is v2.0.

**Repositioned:** the old **Field-Guide** (Observe) leaves the public lineup — its "what teams did"
mission becomes Design's problem-first applied volume. A **private self-audit** of your own work stays
a tentative personal artifact, outside the public series.

Research backbone: 23 strict-live dossiers (external `~/Claude/`), all D1–D5, Waves 1–7 done — they
back the Design volumes (Vol 2 ← tool / MCP / sub-agent / multi-agent / build-vs-buy dossiers; Vol 3 ←
eval + ops dossiers). Scaffold: consumes `book-scaffold-astro ^4.18.0`.

### Conventions
- **Duplication is fine** — the Cert guide especially must stand fully alone.
- **Every explanation is complete where it sits** — never "see the other book for the real version."
- **Cross-refs are bidirectional breadcrumbs** — so updating a topic surfaces every place it's covered.

## Shipped
- **Research program complete** — 23 strict-live dossiers, Waves 1–7, all D1–D5 (2026-05-27).
- **Books un-fused → single trunk** — `architect-reference` split into Cert + Design (2026-06-01).
- **Cert book** — 30 ch + Round-2 self-contained study-guide conversion (2026-06-02).
- **Design Vol 1** — Environment & Context first full draft, 11 ch (2026-05-30).
- **Handbook Part I** — ch01–04 prose (2026-05-25).
- **Model re-architecture + doc-set reconcile** — 5 books → 3 + glossary; this roadmap (2026-06-08).
- **Deferred-debt batch** — research-lint green (matcher fix) + scaffold → 4.18 (#96 cross-book XRef) + cert-coverage Design column (2026-06-08).
- **Cert factual-accuracy audit + freshness pipeline** — 13 ch re-verified vs live docs (Opus 4.7→4.8 cutover + count/citation drift); a curriculum→live-dossier freshness loop: cert-audit **Check 12** (staleness) + **Check 13** (correctness-currency) + a factored-CoVe gate + `last_reviewed` marker (2026-06-08).
- **Cert study-apparatus spine wired** — consumed the scaffold v4.17 spine: `examDomains` + the `questions` collection + the static `/practice-exam` route + `<ObjectiveMap>` (landing page), seeded 10-question bank (2/domain, chapter-grounded); build green in-workspace (2026-06-09).
- **YouTube-talks source pool + guide-impact + source watch-map (2026-06-17)** — new external `youtube_talks` dossier (134 talks, 103 indexed, `synthesis.md` = 12 trend claims; **tri-engine audited** Codex+Gemini+Claude). In-repo bridge: [`research-program/youtube-talks-guide-impact.md`](./research-program/youtube-talks-guide-impact.md) (the 12 claims mapped to chapter impact — staleness / framing / gaps / convergence / directional; tri-engine audited) + [`research-program/source-registry.md`](./research-program/source-registry.md) (the source-first **watch-map** — standing feeds + code/samples + discovery method + cadence; **decisions.md D8**; tri-engine audited, dead-link-checked). **Deferred next phases:** the recurring **change-digest** (what's new · what changed · new samples · impact on the books) and a **scheduled freshness/automation agent** (wire the `[feed]` sources + revive the cert-tracking agent + the freshness heartbeat).

## v1.0 targets (what "done" means; ordering committed under Next)

Every book's v1.0 additionally means **published at its public URL** (deployment plan below: draft
banner + `noindex` come *off* at v1.0).

| Book | v1.0 = | Gated on |
|---|---|---|
| Handbook | all 15 ch ported from LaTeX (Parts I–IV); labels/XRefs resolve; published | authoring time; **step 0 = clone `brandon-behring/claude-best-practices`** (sources not local) |
| Cert | 30 ch (done) + **factual-accuracy audit (done 2026-06-08)** + **depth (Round-2, 2026-06-02)** + study apparatus; published | spine **WIRED 2026-06-09**; **upstream epic #122 COMPLETE 2026-06-10** (v4.19–v4.22); **Sprint 1 apparatus adoption DONE 2026-06-12** + **Sprint 2 bank expansion DONE 2026-06-12 (75-q bank, ≥2/ch, cert-audit 14/14)** — cert track in-repo work complete; next is deployment (#14) |
| Design | Vols 1–3 (Vol 1 polished + Vols 2–3 authored from existing dossiers); published; applied vol = v2.0 | **Vols 2–3 AUTHORED — Design v1.0 content COMPLETE 2026-06-14 (28 ch, 34 pages); next = deploy (#14) + Vol-1 polish (#17)** |
| Glossary | infra + initial shared term set + deep-links; published | **v1 SHIPPED 2026-06-13** — canonical `glossary/terms/` (70 terms) synced into the cert book; `/glossary` + `/flashcards` live; cert-audit Check 15. Remaining: inline `<Term>` retrofit + wiring handbook/Design consumers (on their deploys) |

## Next — two horizons (adopted 2026-06-12)

> Sizing: **S/M/L + estimated sessions**, no calendar dates (solo, variable availability — dates
> drift into falsehood). Calibration: the 30-ch `/loop` study-guide conversion ≈ 1 day; handbook
> Part I (4 ch + supplements) ≈ 1–2 sessions.

### Horizon 1 — committed (the cert track)
- **Sprint 1 — apparatus adoption** — ✅ **DONE 2026-06-12** (1 session). Scaffold bumped `^4.18` →
  `^4.23` across all three workspaces; the cert book wired end-to-end: `<Diagnostic>` ×30 **with
  authored answer keys** (replacing the hand-faked DIKTA sections; cert-audit Check 9 now requires
  the component), `<PartReview>` ×5, scored **ExamRunner** on `/practice-exam`, `<AssessmentTest>`
  on `/assessment`, `/answers` rationale appendix, #10 folded (`BOOK_PROFILE=tools` via script
  prefixes). **Scope note:** `<Glossary>` + flashcards deferred to item 3 — the flashcards deck
  derives from the `glossary` collection, which is exactly that item's deliverable. Plan + recon
  record: [`plans/done/2026-06-12_cert-apparatus-adoption.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-12_cert-apparatus-adoption.md).
- **Sprint 2 — question-bank expansion** — ✅ **DONE 2026-06-12** (1 session). Bank grown from the
  10-q seed to **75 questions**, every chapter ≥2, weighted to the CCA-F blueprint
  (D1=21/D2=13/D3=15/D4=14/D5=12). 62 new application-level MCQs authored one-agent-per-chapter
  (grounded only in each chapter's prose), then a per-chapter adversarial reviewer pass; a new
  **cert-audit Check 14** enforces the ≥2/chapter floor permanently. Every item lands in the scored
  `/practice-exam`, `/assessment`, `/answers`, and the landing `<ObjectiveMap>` (verified 75/75).
  Plan + post-hoc log: [`plans/done/2026-06-12_cert-bank-expansion.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-12_cert-bank-expansion.md).
- **Riding along:** the cert tail — 27 advisory over-cap MarginNotes; `last_verified` cadence on the
  feature-surface chapters (Checks 12/13 are the tripwire).

### Horizon 2 — committed order (2026-06-12)
3. **Glossary infra** — ✅ **DONE 2026-06-13** (1 session). Shared term layer stood up: canonical
   `glossary/terms/**.mdx` (single source of truth) synced into each consuming book's gitignored
   `src/content/glossary/` by `scripts/sync-glossary.mjs` (wired into predev+prebuild). v1 bank =
   **70 terms** from the **cert book's own vocabulary** — *not* the dossiers' `agent_index/`, which
   on inspection hold no structured glossary sections (the original harvest premise was wrong).
   Authored per-domain (harvest → dedup → author → adversarial review, all-OK), domain-tagged (D1–D5)
   + see-linked; **cert-audit Check 15** enforces integrity. Cert `/glossary` + `/flashcards` now live
   (closes the Sprint-1 flashcards deferral). **Deferred** (tracked): inline `<Term>` retrofit across
   the 30 chapters; wiring the handbook/Design consumers (on their deploy/port — infra + script ready).
   Plan + post-hoc: [`plans/done/2026-06-13_glossary-infra.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-13_glossary-infra.md).
4. **Handbook Parts II–IV port** *(M–L, ~4–6 sessions)* — ch05–15 + 3 appendices, to the proven
   Part-I template. **Step 0: `git clone` `brandon-behring/claude-best-practices`** (private; the
   LaTeX sources are NOT on this machine).
5. **Design v1.0 CONTENT COMPLETE — Vols 1–3 all authored (28 ch, 34 pages), 2026-06-14.** Vol 2 (ch12–20)
   + **Vol 3 (ch21–28: spine · prompt-eval · agent-eval · observability · cost · HITL · security · capstone)**,
   authored from the eval+ops dossiers with full Vol-1-parity apparatus + per-chapter TikZ figures; gate
   (`design-audit` 0 FAIL + build) green. ch27 holds the volume's one genuine convergence
   (design-by-construction), the lethal trifecta attributed to Willison, ASR framed reduce-not-eliminate.
   **Remaining for Design: deploy (#14), `<Term>` retrofit (#15), Vol-1 Round-2 polish (#17), then the
   applied volume (v2.0, item 6).** Post-hoc:
   [`plans/done/2026-06-14_design-vol3-eval-ops.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-14_design-vol3-eval-ops.md) (Vol 3) ·
   [`plans/done/2026-06-14_design-vol2-orchestration-half.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-14_design-vol2-orchestration-half.md)
   (Vol 2 orchestration) · [`plans/done/2026-06-13_design-vol2-tools-half.md`](./plans/done/2026-06-13_design-vol2-tools-half.md) (Vol 2 tools).
6. **Applied volume** (Design v2.0).

### Deployment (decided 2026-06-16 — supersedes the 2026-06-12 Pages/subdomain plan)
**Host = Cloudflare Workers (static assets); apex + subroutes via combined-dist.** One Worker
serves `claude-books.brandon-behring.dev` with each book at `/architect/`, `/design/`,
`/agentic-coding/`, `/handbook/` and a hub landing at the root. `scripts/assemble-hub.mjs` (run by
the root `build`) builds each book into `dist/<subroute>/`; `wrangler.toml` serves `./dist`. **No
per-book Workers, no service-binding proxy** — one Worker for the whole apex.

- **Why this supersedes the per-subdomain plan:** the only blocker for path-style apex hosting was
  upstream **#140** (base-unaware absolute links); that is **fixed in scaffold v4.25** (#140/#141),
  so links are base-aware and subroutes work. Apex+subroutes keeps the series under one coherent
  home (and one Worker) instead of scattered `cert./design./handbook.` subdomains.
- Each book sets `base: '/<subroute>/'` + `site: https://claude-books.brandon-behring.dev` in
  `astro.config.mjs`; all books are on scaffold **^4.25**. The **Agentic Coding** book (cross-tool
  "Use") was folded in from `book-template-astro` (v3→v4) as the `agentic-coding/` workspace.
- **Drafts deployed, noindex:** the Handbook ships served-but-noindex (`dist/robots.txt` →
  `Disallow: /handbook/`) until its v1.0; it's omitted from the hub landing.
- **User-side go-live (the gate):** add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` repo secrets
  (for deploy-workflows), make the repo public (after the secret/licensing sweep), disconnect the
  stray Workers Builds project, merge → Actions deploys the `brandon-behring-claude-books` Worker,
  then bind `claude-books.brandon-behring.dev` in the dashboard. See `docs/deploy-cloudflare.md`.
- **Gated items:** (a) **repo-public** — a deliberate visibility flip + full-history secret/leak
  sweep; unlocks the dormant edit-this-page links + per-chapter Discussions; (b) **per-book v1.0
  flip** — noindex off, draft banner off.

### Ops lane (each on its own trigger)
- Revive the weekly **cert-tracking agent** (dormant; diff log stops at the 2026-05-22 baseline) —
  *trigger unchanged: the manual cadence becomes a chore.*
- **Freshness-loop heartbeat** re-run — *per model release or quarterly* (recipe in
  [`design/2026-06-08_curriculum-live-dossier-loop.md`](./design/2026-06-08_curriculum-live-dossier-loop.md) §3);
  the same heartbeat **re-verifies the 23 external dossiers** (`bib_ledger` `stale_after` radar),
  not just the cert chapters. Now also sweep the **`youtube_talks` source pool** (cache+index+on-cite,
  external) and apply its [`youtube-talks-guide-impact.md`](./research-program/youtube-talks-guide-impact.md)
  staleness items (the D5.6 model-name table; the effort-dial / MCP-ladder framing refreshes).
- **Figures pipeline** — TikZ→SVG via the scaffold's `build-figures` (shipped v4.2); *trigger: the
  first chapter needing a new diagram — expected during the handbook port.*
- Upstream **#83** — roll the v4.8.0 provenance backfill out to the consumer books (P3).
- Upstream **#140/#141** (base-unaware absolute links) — **fixed in scaffold v4.25**; unblocks the
  apex+subroutes deployment above (book links are now base-aware).

## Known debt (tracked, with triggers)
- **Cert apparatus — DONE end-to-end (upstream + adoption + bank).** Upstream epic #122 closed
  2026-06-10 (#110/#111/#112-UI/#113/#114/#115/#116 across v4.19–v4.22); **Sprint 1 adoption**
  consumed `^4.23` and wired `<Diagnostic>`/`<PartReview>`/ExamRunner/`<AssessmentTest>`/`/answers`
  (2026-06-12); **Sprint 2** grew the bank to **75 questions** (≥2/chapter, cert-audit Check 14
  enforces it). Remaining cert tail is advisory only (27 over-cap MarginNotes; `last_verified`
  cadence) — see "Riding along". `<Glossary>`/`/flashcards` **shipped 2026-06-13** (Glossary sprint;
  the deck derives from the `glossary` collection).
- **`research-program/content-map.md` topic→book map predates multi-volume Design** — rows still map
  to the old book set. *Trigger:* when authoring a Design volume needs the precise atom→section map.
- **YouTube-talks → guide impact (2026-06-16)** — the `youtube_talks` source pool's 12 trend claims
  mapped to current chapters; prioritized report:
  [`research-program/youtube-talks-guide-impact.md`](./research-program/youtube-talks-guide-impact.md).
  **One correctness item** — the D5.6 model-name/cutoff table (Fable 5 / Mythos 5 generation now out →
  re-anchor vs `anthropic-models-overview`, not the conference talk). **Two framing refreshes that are
  also citation wins** — the effort-dial model (cert D2.3 + Design ch16) and the explicit
  primitives→custom→MCP ladder (cert D2.4 + Design ch15). Sizing **S**. The **new-primitive gaps**
  (Managed Agents, evals-as-engine, auto-mode/Routines, memory+dreaming, skills-governance,
  spec-writing + 7 glossary terms) **create no new work** — they route to already-planned authoring
  (handbook ch05–15 port = Horizon-2 item 4; Design applied vol = item 6; glossary `<Term>` retrofit).
  *Trigger:* the staleness items ride the **freshness heartbeat** (Ops lane; Checks 12/13); the gaps +
  convergence citations land **as each owning chapter is next authored/edited**. Honest-tiering caveat
  in the report: ch26 (auto-mode) + ch10 (memory) stay *directional notes*, not corrections — the talks
  are Anthropic's product direction, and those chapters' caution may be more correct.
  *Independently audited 2026-06-17 (Codex + Gemini + Claude tri-engine review →
  `~/Claude/research_agent_youtube_talks/external_audit_report.md`): grounding / methodology (103/103
  sha256) / citations / honest-tiering all clean, **0 surviving P1**. Unanimous correction — the "one
  correctness item" above re-tiers to a **freshness-UPDATE** (the model table isn't wrong); plus 2 backing
  timestamps to tighten. Fixes proposed, not yet applied.*

## Authority map (who owns which truth — prevents re-drift)
- **ROADMAP** = forward plan + current snapshot + decisions log.
- **BOOK-MAP** = the book model, scopes, lenses, XRef convention.
- **REPO-MAP** = git topology + where things live.
- **cert-coverage** = cert-book status (authority) + the D1–D5 task matrix.
- **scaffold-gaps** = scaffold epic / issue status.
- **research-program/** = the strict-live dossiers + their topic graph.

## Decisions log
- Single content-bearing trunk (`main`); feature branches retired to `archive/*` tags (2026-06-01).
- Un-fused 2026-06-01: Cert (`architect-reference`) + Design (`agentic-systems-design`) are siblings.
- **Re-architected 2026-06-08: public = 3 books + glossary layer** (down from 5). Field-Guide leaves
  the public lineup (→ Design's problem-first applied volume; private self-audit personal).
- **Design is the broad book, multi-volume** (Env&Context → Tools&Orchestration → Eval&Ops + applied);
  **Design v1.0 = Vols 1–3.**
- **Glossary = shared infrastructure**, not a read-through book.
- **XRef convention:** duplication OK (Cert stands alone); complete-in-place explanations;
  bidirectional breadcrumbs. (Refines the old "Design points outward only" rule.)
- Cert book genre = self-contained study guide (Round-2, 2026-06-02).
- Research program complete (Waves 1–7); dossiers external, bridge via `docs/research-program/`.
- Forward arc: per-book v1.0 criteria defined; **ordering left provisional** (2026-06-08).
- **Two-horizon sequencing adopted (2026-06-12):** Horizon 1 = committed cert track (apparatus
  adoption → bank expansion); Horizon 2 = recommended-but-revisable book order with explicit
  triggers + an ops lane. Prompted by upstream epic #122 completing 2026-06-10.
- **Horizon 2 hardened to a COMMITTED order (2026-06-12, refinement pass):** glossary → handbook →
  Design Vols 2–3 → applied. Rationale: glossary is S-sized post-#115 and compounds with early
  deploys; the handbook port is template-proven mechanical work one `git clone` from unblocked;
  the freshness loop keeps the Design dossiers warm, so sequencing them last costs no accuracy.
- **Deployment decided (2026-06-12; SUPERSEDED 2026-06-16 → Workers apex+subroutes, see Deployment §):** Cloudflare Pages (DNS colocation with `brandon-behring.dev`),
  one project per book, drafts deployed early **from the private repo**, `noindex` + draft banner
  until each v1.0; domain target = `*.brandon-behring.dev` **subdomains** (root base — paths under
  the apex stay gated on upstream #140). **Repo-public is a separate gated decision** (deliberate
  flip + full-history sweep); until then edit-links/Discussions stay dormant.
- **Hub+sibling repo split considered and declined (2026-06-08):** single-repo workspace is final; per-book extraction stays available on a real trigger (see each book's `SPLIT.md`).
- **Meta-doc model de-duplicated (2026-06-08):** `docs/BOOK-MAP.md` is the single full statement of the book model; other meta-docs carry a one-line identity + a pointer, not a restatement (drift-proofing).
